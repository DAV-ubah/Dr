            <h1 class="life">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h1>
<p class="life2">
1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa. <br><br>

1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University 
of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
known as the "National Youth Administration". <br><br>

1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money.
Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them",
he said. "All of this left scars on me."<br><br>

1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
Forestry Service. <br><br>

1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,
who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. <br><br>

1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to
control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. <br><br>

1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology. <br><br>

1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to
head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 
years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
resistent wheat - including different varieties for each
major climate on Earth. <br><br>

1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each 
season, doubling wheat yields. <br><br>

1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat 
with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain 
that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 
95% of Mexico's wheat. <br><br>

1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains 
of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help 
mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding 
population. <br><br>
1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize <br><br>

1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically 
increase their maize and sorghum yields <br><br>

1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas 
A&M University <br><br>

2005 - states "we will have to double the world food 
supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified 
crops are the only way we can meet the demand, 
as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not 
inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically 
modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long 
before we called it science, people were selecting 
the best breeds." <br><br>
2009 - dies at the age of 95. <br><br>

"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-
reaching contribution <br>
 that one man's towering intellect,
persistence and scientific vision can make to <br>
 human peace 
and progress."
